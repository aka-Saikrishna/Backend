# ## Important Notes: 
Two things we have remember while connecting with database:
1) Whenever we are trying to connect with database we face issue, so to handle those issues we have to use "try catch" or "Promises"

2) Database is always in another continent. When we want to access database it will take some time, it means we have use "Async - await". 
These is the better apporoach while connecting with database and get access of data from database.
